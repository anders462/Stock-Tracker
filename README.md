1. User Story: I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.		

2. User Story: I can add new stocks by their symbol name.		

3. User Story: I can remove stocks.		

4. User Story: I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
